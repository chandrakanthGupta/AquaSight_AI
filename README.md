💧 AquaSight AI (Streamlit Version)
Hybrid AI-Based Water Quality Detection System
---------------------------------------------------------
This was the first complete version of AquaSight AI.

What started as a simple machine learning experiment gradually evolved into a hybrid AI system with interpretability, visualization, and public deployment.

This version was built entirely using Streamlit and represents a major step in my practical AI learning journey.

🚀 Project Overview

AquaSight AI analyzes drinking water safety using:

A trained Random Forest model

A custom Water Quality Index (WQI) scoring system

A hybrid risk formula combining both

Final Risk = 60% ML Probability + 40% WQI Deviation

Instead of just predicting “Safe” or “Unsafe,” the system provides:

Unsafe risk percentage

WQI score

Hybrid risk value

Clear safety status

🧠 What Makes This Version Important

This version took significant time because it required:

Understanding ML beyond notebook experiments

Handling missing data properly

Managing class imbalance

Using probability instead of raw classification

Designing a custom WQI logic from scratch

Creating hybrid decision architecture

Building dual interfaces:

Citizen Portal

Authority Dashboard

Adding charts and visualizations

Debugging multiple logic and integration issues

Deploying the application publicly

It was my first full AI-to-deployment experience.

🎯 Why This Version Matters

This version was not just about building a model.

It was about learning how to:

Convert ML into a usable product


Combine data science with practical implementation

Think beyond accuracy and focus on interpretability

Build something deployable and presentable

This Streamlit version laid the foundation for the later Flask full-stack version
